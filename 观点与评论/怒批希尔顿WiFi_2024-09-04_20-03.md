@希尔顿Hilton 让你们CEO来回复这个微博
@ParisHilton 希望你正视问题——立即处理
我住在你们新西兰皇后镇希尔顿酒店
我没想到希尔顿竟然针对不同的客户
提供不同的WiFi 速度，愚蠢的政策
普通用户想选用高速度的WiFi
竟然还得花钱买
退一步来说，花钱买我也接受了
问题是，选择了低速度WiFi
就无法再选择高速度的了
无法切换WiFi了!
我操作了半小时，都没切换成功!
导致我，无法直播! 无法赚钱!
I am angry !
@ Hilton Hilton asked your CEO to reply to this Weibo.
@ParisHilton wants you to face up to the problem-deal with it immediately.
I am staying at the Hilton Hotel in Queenstown, New Zealand. I didn't expect Hilton to provide different WiFi speeds for different customers. Stupid policy: Ordinary users want to choose high-speed WiFi, but they still have to spend money to buy it. To take a step back, I also accept it. The problem is that if you choose low-speed WiFi, you can't choose high-speed WiFi and you can't switch WiFi! I've been operating for half an hour
but I haven't switched successfully! Cause me, can't live! Unable to make money!
I am angry ! http://t.cn/RJCyUOM
